            <h2> Monday </h2>
            <p>
                After the presentation of CA week 2 in class, our group found a room with a white board and went over the itinerary and collected our thoughts. We went over the criterias, and delegated the task to the most competent team member for it.
                Made a Git Repository.
                Made a Waffle board view.
                Made sql queries, and generated a database from it and then generated initial Entity classes.
            </p>

            <h2> Tuesday </h2>
            <p>
                We simplified the database so that address and city info were a 
                single table, infoentity included the phonenumber and person and
                hobby were joined to a single table, we don’t care about performance right now.
                Coded the Entity classes and  facades added all packages, the 
                generated ones were not precise enough. 
                Git f...'ed up!!!
            </p>

            <h2> Wednesday </h2>
            <p> 
                Trouble with Git again, we made a new repository.
                Diana and Kristin were on unit testing and REST - facade and 
                personService get/add/edit.
                Emil on Git fixing, the separating address and zip codes again,
                since we realized, why they had to separate. Jarmo on REST.
                Persistence class cost us a lot of trouble even though it was 
                commented out from Git push it kept on being commited.
                At this point we have made four different Git repositories, 
                and all of us have deleted the whole project from Netbeans and 
                cloned again at least once. In the last two days Git has cost us
                about 5+ hours of work time... each.
            </p>

            <h2> Thursday </h2>
            Today things began to come together. The Git is still giving us a 
            lot of grief. A lot of hate towards Git now. Emil is working on ajax
            and javaScript. Diana and Kristin on JUnit testing and further entity
            mapping. Jarmo has been stuck helping all three in the group with 
            Git problems.

            <h2> Friday </h2>
            <p>
                Jarmo and Kristin, working on REST and facades. Persistence 
                class keeps conflicting when uploaded to Git, Git does not let 
                us push, so everything has to be done twice. Emil worked on 
                JQuery/ajax/Javascript page and the documentation. Diana at 
                home working on documentation of Junit tests. 
            </p>
            <h2> Saturday </h2>
            <p>
                Kristin tried to come up with better sql queries, maybe that 
                will fix the REST. Emil and Diana on documentation. Jarmo took 
                over the task of finding out what is wrong with the Entity’s or 
                their mappings. Emil worked on the html pages.
                Also Jarmo started working on the ajax-calls, more so creating the
                barebones for them in case the backend got fixed so implementing
                them wouldn't take much time.
