                THere's not much to tell about this portion of the project. Due
                to time constraints caused by Git problems and REST-api troubles
                we went with just what was shown in lecture slides and examples.
                I (Jarmo) did try to implement something on my own but did not have
                time to see it through so I reverted my changes.
